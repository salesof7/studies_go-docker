# Full Cycle Rocks!!

This repository represents some of my studies - on the Full Cycle Platform - 
about Docker, which uses the concept of Multistage Building to optimize an image for less than 2MB.

## Installation

You can run the code using the command:

```bash 
docker run salesof7/studies_go-docker
```
